issues rised during releasing product-tracker: 1.2.0

These challenges faced when start developing with android studio 3.0.1
-- same version problem as new apk exists inside release folder and i was uploading from the app folders apk
-- Fully shadowed APK as Retain clicked

These challenges gave me a lots of pain. Cause for directory problem there was no community support and i solved this by my debugging skills. Starting a new fresh project with same package name.
I wasted high time with generate asigned apk.
