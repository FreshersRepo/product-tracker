# Software development lifecycle (SDLC)
**Course:** Software Engineering (CSE411)

**Implementation:** Sci vs Tech 

**Instructed by:** [Sadia Sharmin](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sadia_Sharmin3) madam


What I learnt(science & technology) from my software engineering course, instucted by [Sadia Sharmin](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sadia_Sharmin3) madam, those are trying to add here. 
Basically, I like to implement technology first (as software touches every corner of our lives and we solve problem from land|agri to space|astro. through software) afterthen try to feel the beauty|power of science and its suitable time for me to add this science to all of my projects as i have been eagerly waiting for that.

1. Preliminary investigation
   - Determine if a new system is needed
   - Three primary tasks:
     - suggest alternative solution
     - define problem: by observation and interview what info is needed by whom, when, where and why?
     - prepare a short report: feasibility report, project plan
2. System|requirement analysis
   - Listen to customers | users demand
   - Write storybook, usecases, sequence diagram
   - Sequencial flow chart
   - Grand chart: Possible development schedule
3. Design
   - Design from technical view
   - UX & UI & Architectural design
   - System design report
4. Development
   - from sketch
   - use others services
   - Testing
     - Module | Unit test: part by part test
     - Intregration test: All parts at once
5. Implementation
   - Upgrade from old version
   - Install new version & provide training
6. Operation & maintenance: 
   - Daily observation
   - Periodic evaluation & update
